    <h4 class="reveal-heading">The Circular Ruins</h4>
        <p class="textbox-col-reveal"> No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, 
            no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud, but in a 
            few days there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man 
            came from the South and that his home had been one of those 
            numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the 
            mountain, where the Zend language has not been contaminated by 
            Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that 
            the grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with pushing 
            aside (probably, without feeling) the blades which were lacerating 
            his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to the 
            circular enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse, which 
            sometimes was the color of flame and now was that of ashes. 
            This circle was a temple which had been devoured by ancient fires, 
            profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose god no longer received 
            the homage of men. The stranger stretched himself out beneath the 
            pedestal. He was awakened by the sun high overhead. He was not 
            astonished to find that his wounds had healed; he closed his 
            pallid eyes and slept, not through weakness of flesh but through 
            determination of will.
