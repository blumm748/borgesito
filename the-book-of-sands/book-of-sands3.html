I  invited  him  in,  pointing  to  a  chair.  He paused awhile  before  speaking.  A  kind  of  gloom  emanated from  him — as  it does  now  from  me. "I  sell  Bibles,"  he  said. Somewhat  pedantically,  I  replied,  "In  this  house are  several English  Bibles, including  the  first—John  Wiclif's. I  also  have  Cipriano  de  Valera's, Luther's — which,  from  a  literary  viewpoint,  is  the worst — and  a  Latin  copy  of  the  Vulgate.  As you see,  it's  not  exactly  Bibles  I  stand  in  need  of." After  a  few  moments  of  silence,  he  said,  "I  don't only  sell  Bibles.  I  can  show  you  a  holy  book  I  came across  on  the  outskirts  of  Bikaner.  It  may  interest you." He  opened  the  suitcase  and  laid  the book  on  a table.  It  was  an  octavo  volume,  bound  in  cloth. There  was  no  doubt  that  it  had passed  through many  hands.  Examining  it,  I  was  surprised  by  its unusual  weight.  On  the  spine  were  the  words "Holy  Writ"  and,  below  them,  "Bombay." "Nineteenth  century,  probably,"  I  remarked. "I  don't  know,"  he  said.  "I've  never  found  out."
