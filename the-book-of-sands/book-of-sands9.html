"It's  a  deal,"  he  said. It  amazed  me  that  he  did  not  haggle.  Only  later was  I  to  realize  that  he had  entered  my  house  with his  mind  made  up  to  sell  the  book.  Without  counting the  money, he  put  it  away. We  talked  about  India,  about  Orkney,  and about  the  Norwegian  jails  who  once  ruled  it.  It was  night  when  the  man  left.  I  have  not  seen him again,  nor  do  I  know  his  name. I  thought  of  keeping  the  Book  of  Sand  in  the  space  left  on  the  shelf  by  the  Wiclif,  but  in  the  end I  decided  to  hide  it  behind  the  volumes of  a  broken set  of  The  Thousand  and  One  Nights.  I  went to  bed  and  did  not  sleep.  At  three  or  four  in  the morning,  I  turned  on  the  light.  I  got  down  the  impossible book  and  leafed  through  its  pages.  On one  of  them  I  saw  engraved  a  mask.  The  upper  corner  of  the  page  carried  a  number,  which  I  no longer  recall,  elevated  to  the  ninth  power. I  showed  no  one  my  treasure.  To  the  luck  of owning  it  was  added  the  fear  of having  it  stolen, and  then  the  misgiving  that  it  might  not  truly  be infinite.
